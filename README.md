# Descriptive Analysis of Student Complaint in UCW 
# Objective
The main objective of this project was to conduct a descriptive analysis of student complaints at University Canada West (UCW). 

The purpose of this analysis was to:

-. Summarize key characteristics of student complaints.

-. Identify trends in the nature and frequency of complaints.

-. Provide actionable insights to improve the student experience and enhance administrative policies.
# Dataset
The dataset consisted of student complaint records from UCW, including the following key features:

1. Complaint ID: Unique identifier for each complaint.

2. Student ID: Unique identifier for each student filing the complaint.

3. Complaint Date: Date and time when the complaint was submitted.

4. Complaint Type: Type of complaint (e.g., academic issues, facilities, administration).

5. Severity Level: Rated on a scale from low to high based on impact on the student.

6. Resolution Status: Status of the complaint (e.g., resolved, pending, unresolved).

7. Department Involved: The department responsible for addressing the complaint (e.g., academic, student services, facilities).

8. Location: Campus or department associated with the complaint.

# Methodology
1. Data Collection and Preparation:

-. Tools Used: Python (Pandas) for loading and cleaning the dataset.

-. Process: Cleaned the data by addressing missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates. Ensured that the dataset was ready for analysis.


2. Descriptive Statistics:

-. Complaint Frequency: Calculated the total number of complaints and the average number of complaints per month.

-. Complaint Type Distribution: Summarized complaints by category (e.g., academic, facilities, administration).

-. Severity Analysis: Measured the distribution of complaints by severity level to understand the impact on student satisfaction.

-. Resolution Status: Calculated the percentage of complaints that were resolved, pending, or unresolved.


3. Data Visualization:

-. Time Series Analysis: Created graphs to show the number of complaints filed over time, identifying spikes or decreases in complaints.

-. Bar Charts: Visualized the distribution of complaints by type and department.

-. Pie Charts: Displayed the breakdown of resolution statuses (resolved vs. unresolved complaints).

-. Heatmaps: Illustrated complaints by location or department, identifying areas with higher complaint volumes.


4. Student Segmentation:

-. Segmented students based on the frequency and severity of complaints.

-. Analyzed patterns in complaints across different student demographics (e.g., domestic vs. international students).


5. Insights and Findings:

-. Peak Complaint Periods: Identified high-complaint periods during midterms, finals, and registration times.

-. Frequent Complaint Types: Noted that the majority of complaints were related to academic issues and administrative processes.

-. Resolution Effectiveness: Found a trend of delays in resolving high-severity complaints, particularly those related to academic matters.


6. Recommendations:

-. Implement targeted interventions during peak complaint periods (e.g., midterms and registration) to reduce volume.

-. Streamline academic support services and administrative processes to address the most frequent types of complaints.

-. Establish a more robust complaint resolution system to improve response time for high-severity issues.
